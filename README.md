# Apache-Hive
My Big Data journey with Hive

**Apache Hive** is built on top of Apache Hadoop.  Due to the close integration with Hadoop it is designed to work quickly on petabytes of data.

My experience using Hive on Cloudera.  
CDW - Cloudera Data Warehouse
CDP - Cloudera Data Visualization

Hive is recommended for ETL jobs and Impala for BI and dashboards
Hue on Impala for SQL query
